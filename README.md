# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can execute the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the application in development mode.\
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

The app will automatically reload upon code changes.\
Any linting errors will also appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for additional details.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app for production and outputs it to the `build` folder.\
The production build is optimized for performance and includes minified files with hashed filenames.

Your app will be ready for deployment after this step.\
For deployment instructions, see the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Caution: This action is irreversible. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert the changes.**

If the default build tools and configurations do not meet your needs, you can use `eject` to gain full control. This will copy all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project.

While all other commands will continue to function, they will now reference the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. Use this feature only if necessary.
